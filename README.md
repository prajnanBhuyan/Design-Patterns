# Design Pattern Examples in C#

## Creational Design Patterns

- [x] Factory Method : Create instances of derived classes
- [x] Abstract Factory : Create instances of several classes belonging to different families
- [x] Builder : Separates an object construction from its representation
- [ ] Prototype : Create a duplicate object or clone of the object
- [ ] Singleton : Ensures that a class can has only one instance

## Structural Design Patterns

- [ ] Adapter : Match interfaces of different classes
- [ ] Bridge : Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation
- [ ] Composite : A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- [ ] Decorator : Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- [ ] Façade : A single class that represents an entire complex system
- [ ] Flyweight : Minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects
- [ ] Proxy : Provides a surrogate object, which references to other object

## Behavioral Design Patterns

- [ ] Chain of Responsibility: Passes a request among a list or chain of objects.
- [ ] Command: Wraps a request under an object as a command and passed to invoker object.
- [ ] Interpreter: Implements an expression interface to interpret a particular context.
- [ ] Iterator: Provides a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without knowing its underlying structure.
- [ ] Mediator: Allows multiple objects to communicate with each other’s without knowing each other’s structure.
- [ ] Memento: Capture the current state of an object and store it in such a manner that it can be restored at a later time without breaking the rules of encapsulation.
- [ ] Observer: Allows an object (subject) to publish changes to its state and other objects (observer) that depend upon that object are automatically notified of any changes to the subject's state.
- [ ] State: Alters the behavior of an object when it’s internal state changes.
- [ ] Strategy: Allows a client to choose an algorithm from a family of algorithms at run-time and gives it a simple way to access it.
- [ ] Visitor: Creates and performs new operations onto a set of objects without changing the object structure or classes.
- [ ] Template Method: Defines the basic steps of an algorithm and allow the implementation of the individual steps to be changed.
